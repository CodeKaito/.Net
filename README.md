- ## Introduction

### .Net
.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and more.

### Languages
You can write .NET apps in C#, F#, or Visual Basic.

C# is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.
F# is a programming language that makes it easy to write succinct, robust, and performant code.
Visual Basic is an approachable language with a simple syntax for building type-safe, object-oriented apps.

### Cross Platform
Whether you're working in C#, F#, or Visual Basic, your code will run natively on any compatible operating system. You can build many types of apps with .NET. Some are cross-platform, and some target a specific set of operating systems and devices.

### One consistent API
.NET provides a standard set of base class libraries and APIs that are common to all .NET applications.

Each app model can also expose additional APIs that are specific to the operating systems it runs on, or the capabilities it provides. For example, ASP.NET is the cross-platform web framework that provides additional APIs for building web apps that run on Linux or Windows.
